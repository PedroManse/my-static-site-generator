# About Me

Hi! My name is Onur Sahin (I use Aiono nickname online). I am a software developer. 

I got my bachelors in Computer Science from Bilkent University in 2021. Since then I worked full time at [Carbon Health](https://carbonhealth.com/). In 2023 I started doing masters in Computer Science/Informatik at [Freiburg University](https://uni-freiburg.de/en/). I love software engineering but I always wanted to try getting into programming languages & formal verification area so I am doing masters to see if I would like it.

I like to play guitar a lot and I want to write my music in the future. I am also a huge music fan (Favorite groups are Opeth and Porcupine Tree). And I have a vinyl collection that is ever growing. I like to play board games. I am not very sportive person but I try to get into bouldering.
