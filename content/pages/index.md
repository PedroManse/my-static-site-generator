# About Me

Hi! I am Onur Sahin, I use Aiono nickname in online platforms. I am a software developer and currently MSc. student in [Freiburg University](https://uni-freiburg.de/en/) focusing on Programming Languages and especially on [Typestate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typestate_analysis).

I got my bachelors in Computer Science from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) in 2021. After graduation, I worked full time at [Carbon Health](https://carbonhealth.com/) as a software engineer until late 2023. In 2023 I started doing masters in Computer Science at [Freiburg University](https://uni-freiburg.de/en/). I love software engineering but I always had an interest in programming languages & formal verification area so currently I am doing masters to get exposed to these fields.

My favorite programming languages are [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I have industrial [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) experience. I really like [Nix](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Nix_package_manager) build system and use [NixOS](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Overview_of_the_NixOS_Linux_distribution) for my daily computer and personal server.

I like to play guitar a lot and I want to write my music in the future. I am also a huge music fan (Favorite groups are Opeth and Porcupine Tree but I listen to a lot of different types of music). And I have a vinyl collection that is ever growing. I like to play board games. I am not very sportive person but I try to get into bouldering (spoiler: I sprained my ankle and it didn't help on my enthusiasm).
