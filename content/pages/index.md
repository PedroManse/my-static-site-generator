# About Me

Hi! I am Onur Sahin, I use Aiono nickname in online platforms. I am a software developer and currently Computer Science MSc. student in [Freiburg University](https://uni-freiburg.de/en/).

I got my bachelors in Computer Science from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) in 2021. After graduation, I worked full time at [Carbon Health](https://carbonhealth.com/) until late 2023. In 2023 I started doing masters in Computer Science at [Freiburg University](https://uni-freiburg.de/en/). I love software engineering but I always wanted to try getting into programming languages & formal verification area so currently I am doing masters to see if I would like it.

I like to play guitar a lot and I want to write my music in the future. I am also a huge music fan (Favorite groups are Opeth and Porcupine Tree but I listen to a lot of different types of music). And I have a vinyl collection that is ever growing. I like to play board games. I am not very sportive person but I try to get into bouldering.
