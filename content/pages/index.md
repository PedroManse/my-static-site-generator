# Aiono's Website

Hi, I am Aiono. I am a software developer. Currently I am studying MsC. student at Freiburg University and work part time as software engineer.

I have 2 years of professional software development experience. I always wanted to try getting into programming languages & formal verification area so I am doing masters to see if I want to pursue it.

I like to play guitar a lot and I want to write my music in the future. I also like listening to music a lot and I have a vinyl collection that is ever growing. I like to play board games. I try to get into bouldering.
