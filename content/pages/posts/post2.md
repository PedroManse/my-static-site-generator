Hi, this is my first ever blog post and of course like everyone else I am just making my own a static site generator so that I have something to write about for my blog.
Programmers love inventing the wheel just for the sake of it.

In all seriousness, I think this blog post can be useful to others, as it states in the title that I have written my static site generator in [OCaml].
So it can be a guide for others who want to write their own static site generators in OCaml.
But my purpose was to use OCaml in a real project so that I learn how to write OCaml and also evaluate how good is OCaml for me.

You may wonder why I choose OCaml, as it's neither very mainstream and also doesn't have huge web community. I could choose JavaScript and probably I would finish the project in much shorter time because there are already 100s of libraries for every single thing I need. That would make sense if I just wanted to get the job done but that's not what I wanted. I have used OCaml before for a textbook, and [despite it's issues](https://borretti.me/article/two-years-ocaml) I overall liked it. It supports functional programming better than most mainstream languages while not being a pure one. It has a module system which is very different than class systems in Java like OOP languages. I feel like OCaml is like Rust but when I am fine with having a GC. Since static site generators doesn't need to be very performant it seemed like a good fit for me. Also, I wanted to have my personal website for a while so writing a static site generator in OCaml seemed like a great fit.
